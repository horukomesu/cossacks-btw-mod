theres source code of old game Cossacks back to war (2000)
its engine based on warcraft 2 engine 

We should rewrite all game into raylib 
rewrite whole game , keeping only old logics
so it will remove all dependencies from windows api, direct draw etc
basically we need to completely refactor game
it builds in x86 now, it should build in x64
C:\coding\libraries\raylib64\
C:\coding\libraries\raylib64\include
C:\coding\libraries\raylib64\libs
